		<p>One of our favorite opportunities each year is working with interns and other developers in the industry to teach and discuss the ever changing web development technologies. With a small team, all of our developers are exposed to every aspect of the development process - design implementation, frontend development (heavily javascript related), UI/UX testing, server configuation, database design &amp; architecture, webservice/API development, responsive web design, and the list goes on and on. This gives our team members the chance to handle the challenges in all phases of web development and gain fundamental knowledge and expertise required.</p>
		<p>Each year we look to bring in a handful of interns to introduce them to the tools, technologies, development strategies, and web best practices to push them forward in their young careers.</p>
